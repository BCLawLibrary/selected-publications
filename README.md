# Selected Publications

[Selected Publications](bc.edu/law-publications) is a JavaScript web application which presents, for each Boston College Law School faculty, a body of their publications. It was originally created as part of Boston College Law Library's migration from Bepress to Ubiquity (2022â€“2023), and was rewritten in 2024 to address certain shortcomings.

This application pulls CSV data from public Google Sheets maintained by the BC Law Library, then parses it using [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) into JSON. The data is then displayed using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/). To filter works by faculty name, we use a custom search bar using the [jQuery UI Autocomplete widget](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), and feed the input into a hidden DataTables search bar for the filtering functionality.

The CSS follows [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) conventions wherever possible.
